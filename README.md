# Basic Todo Application in Go

Welcome to my first Go project! This simple application is designed 
to help me practice and get comfortable with the Go programming language.

### Overview

This ToDo application allows you to create, update, and delete tasks using an in-memory database. It's a minimalistic project that demonstrates core Go features like structs, pointers, functions, error handling, and package management.

### Getting Started

##### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Go installed on your machine:

```bash
go version
```

##### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matheusalecksander/go-todo.git
```

##### Running the Application
Navigate to the project directory and run the application using:

```bash
go run main.go
```

##### Key Concepts Learned

This project helped me understand the following Go concepts:

- [x] **Structs**: Understanding data structures and their fields.
- [x] **Pointers**: Managing memory addresses for efficient data handling.
- [x] **Functions**: Creating reusable blocks of code.
- [x] **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error management.
- [x] **Packages**: Organizing code into modular components.
